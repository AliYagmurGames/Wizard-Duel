# Wizard-Duel
A duel game for wizards.

This is something I am planning to work on in the future. The idea is something like this:

Mouse input directly traanslates into the movement of the character's hand and the wand it holds. So player can make unique wand movements. The game will track these movements and produce certain spells.

I haven't been able to complete the prototype. I will update this page when I do. Hopefully.
